<h2>Why Traveling</h2>

	<p>Traveling more is likely to have a tremendous impact on your mental well-being, especially if you're no used to 
           going out of your comfort zone. Trust me: travel more and your doctor will be happy. Be sure to get in touch with 
           your physician, they might recommend some medication to accompany you in your travels, especially if you're heading to 
           regions of the globe with potentially dangerous diseases. </p>
